Analyze the README.md and follow the links within it to the contents within the ./docs/ subfolder reading those markdown documents to get an understanding of the project that we are working on.  Then analalyze the solution itself to get an idea of what has already been built.  Then start looking at the ./docs/tasks.md as we will need to pick back up on the next unfinished tasks.  After you've done all this analysis report back to me if you agree we are in a state to continue.

Also familiarize yourself with the layout of the solution and it's various projects.

ManagementDashboard = MAUI Blazor Hybrid App
ManagementDashboard.Data = Data Access Layer holding all data models repositories and sql migrations
ManagementDashboard.Core = Where to store common business logic and services created in a testable way
ManagementDashboard.Tests = The unit testing project.

I want you to serve the role of a Software Engineer implementing various features for me.
