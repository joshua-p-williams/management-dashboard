Analyze the README.md and follow the links within it to the contents within the ./docs/ subfolder reading those markdown documents to get an understanding of the project that we are working on.  Then analalyze the solution itself to get an idea of what has already been built.  Then start looking at the ./docs/tasks.md as we will need to pick back up on the next unfinished tasks.  After you've done all this analysis report back to me if you agree we are in a state to continue.

Also familiarize yourself with the layout of the solution and it's various projects.

ManagementDashboard = MAUI Blazor Hybrid App
ManagementDashboard.Data = Data Access Layer holding all data models repositories and sql migrations
ManagementDashboard.Core = Where to store common business logic and services created in a testable way
ManagementDashboard.Tests = The unit testing project.

I want you to serve the role of a Software Engineer implementing various features for me.


We are currently working on the Eisenhower Matrix.  Here is our big plan.

## Step 1: Eisenhower Matrix Feature Analysis

**(A) README.md** - (Read this markdown first, then return to this message)

* Outlines the app’s purpose and modular approach (Eisenhower Matrix is a core feature).
* Mentions vibe coding and iterative, maintainable development.

**(B) feature-eisenhower-matrix.md** - (Read this markdown first, then return to this message)

* Describes user goals: capture, view, and manage tasks in the four Eisenhower quadrants (Do Now, Schedule, Delegate, Delete).
* Mentions drag-and-drop, edit, mark complete, filtering, and visual clarity.
* User Stories:

  * As a user, I want to add a task and assign it to a quadrant.
  * As a user, I want to move tasks between quadrants.
  * As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed.
  * As a user, I want to edit, delete, and view details.
  * As a user, I want visual feedback on overdue or high-priority tasks.

**(C) feature-eisenhower-matrix-database.md** - (Read this markdown first, then return to this message)

* Task data model includes: ID, Title, Description, Quadrant, Due Date, Priority, Status, Created/Modified, Audit Trail.
* Additional fields: Blocked, BlockerReason, CompletedBy, CompletionTimestamp.

**(D) tasks.md** - (Read this markdown first, then return to this message)

* Lists atomic tasks for implementation.
* Covers UI skeleton, CRUD operations, drag-and-drop, filtering, audit trail.

## Step 2: Best-Practice UI/UX Breakdown 

### General Principles

* Responsive: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Bootstrap 5 grid and cards for quadrant layout.
* Accessible: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation.
* Simple, modern look; surface key actions directly in the UI.

---

## Step 3: Developer Instructions (Ready for Co-Pilot Agent)

Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step design spec and guidance you can submit to a developer or Copilot. It breaks down the Eisenhower Matrix feature into clear instructions for implementation using Blazor Components and Bootstrap 5.

---

# **Eisenhower Matrix Task Manager – UI Implementation Instructions**

## 1. **Component Structure**

* **EisenhowerMatrix.razor**: Main feature component (holds the 2x2 quadrant grid).
* **TaskCard.razor**: Reusable component for displaying a single task.
* **TaskEditor.razor**: Modal/dialog for creating/editing a task.
* **TaskAuditTrail.razor**: Component/modal to show task history.

---

## 2. **Page Layout**

* Use a Bootstrap 5 container with a 2x2 grid (`row`/`col-6`).
* Each quadrant is a Bootstrap `Card` with a clear header:

  * **Do Now** (Urgent + Important)
  * **Schedule** (Not Urgent + Important)
  * **Delegate** (Urgent + Not Important)
  * **Delete** (Not Urgent + Not Important)

```html
<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
      <!-- Do Now Quadrant -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-4">
      <!-- Schedule Quadrant -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
      <!-- Delegate Quadrant -->
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
      <!-- Delete Quadrant -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

## 3. **Quadrant Cards**

* Each card shows:

  * Header with quadrant name and icon.
  * "Add Task" button (triggers TaskEditor modal).
  * List of TaskCards for the quadrant.

---

## 4. **Task Card UI**

* Title (bold), due date, status (badge), optional priority icon.
* Inline actions: Edit, Mark Complete, Delete, Audit Trail (see below).
* Visual cues for overdue, blocked, or completed tasks (use Bootstrap badges or text-muted for completed).
* Drag-and-drop support: Allow moving tasks between quadrants (use Blazor events, implement visual feedback).

---

## 5. **Task Editor Modal**

* Bootstrap modal for adding/editing tasks.
* Fields: Title, Description, Quadrant (dropdown), Due Date, Priority, Status (open/completed/blocked), Blocker reason.
* Validation: Title required, due date optional, show errors inline.
* Save/Cancel buttons.
* Use Blazor’s built-in form support and Bootstrap modal styles.

---

## 6. **Task Actions**

* **Edit**: Opens TaskEditor pre-filled.
* **Delete**: Confirms before deletion.
* **Complete/Un-complete**: Toggles status.
* **Audit Trail**: Opens TaskAuditTrail modal.

---

## 7. **Visual Cues**

* **Overdue tasks**: Red badge or exclamation icon.
* **Blocked**: Yellow/orange badge or lock icon, hover for blocker reason.
* **Completed**: Strike-through or faded, green check icon.
* **Priority**: Optional star/exclamation badge.

---

## 8. **Filtering & Sorting**

* (Optionally) Add global filter bar at top (search, show/hide completed, filter by due date/priority).
* Tasks within each quadrant are sorted by:

  * Incomplete, due date ascending, then priority descending.

---

## 9. **Responsiveness & Accessibility**

* All quadrant cards should stack on mobile (full width).
* Use appropriate ARIA roles for buttons, cards, and modal dialogs.
* All actions must be keyboard accessible.

---

## 10. **Styling**

* Use Bootstrap 5 classes only (no custom CSS unless required).
* Cards: `.card`, `.card-header`, `.card-body`.
* Use Bootstrap icons or font-awesome for icons.

---

## 11. **Code Organization**

* Place components in `/Components/EisenhowerMatrix/`.
* Register and route main EisenhowerMatrix page from `App.razor` or relevant navigation.
* Use dependency injection for task repository/data access.
* Ensure state updates propagate correctly when tasks are moved, edited, or deleted.

---

## 12. **Example Razor Markup for Quadrant Card**

```razor
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <span class="me-2"><i class="bi bi-lightning"></i></span>Do Now
    <button class="btn btn-sm btn-primary float-end" @onclick="()=>OpenAddTaskModal('DoNow')">
      <i class="bi bi-plus"></i> Add Task
    </button>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardBody>
    @foreach (var task in Tasks.Where(t => t.Quadrant == 'DoNow')) {
      <TaskCard Task="task" OnEdit="EditTask" OnMove="MoveTask" ... />
    }
  </CardBody>
</Card>
```

---

## 13. **Developer Tasks**

* [ ] Scaffold EisenhowerMatrix.razor, TaskCard.razor, TaskEditor.razor, TaskAuditTrail.razor.
* [ ] Implement Bootstrap 2x2 grid layout.
* [ ] Render tasks by quadrant; enable drag-and-drop movement.
* [ ] Add/edit task modal using Bootstrap modal.
* [ ] Implement task actions (edit, complete, delete, audit trail).
* [ ] Apply badges/icons for status, priority, overdue.
* [ ] Implement filtering/search UI (if specified).
* [ ] Wire up data binding via repository.
* [ ] Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
* [ ] Write basic unit/component tests.

## Change in Direction: Move Tasks Between Quadrants

- **Technical Note:** Drag-and-drop is not reliable in .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid due to platform limitations and interop errors. The team has decided to implement a click-to-move (button or dropdown) approach for moving tasks between quadrants. This will ensure cross-platform reliability and a consistent user experience.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add a Move button or dropdown to each TaskCard to allow users to move tasks between quadrants.
  - Update UI and repository logic to support this action.
  - Test thoroughly on all supported platforms.

**Reference:**

* For data model, use the fields from `feature-eisenhower-matrix-database.md`.
* For workflow/user stories, see `feature-eisenhower-matrix.md`.


Now, we can pick back up where we left off in the WIP.md.
