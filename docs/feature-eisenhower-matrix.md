# ‚úÖ Feature Definition: Eisenhower Matrix Utility

## üéØ Purpose

The **Eisenhower Matrix Utility** helps you prioritize and act on tasks by classifying them across two key dimensions: **Urgency** and **Importance**. This feature enables you to visualize, manage, and track actionable work items in four distinct quadrants, with full lifecycle support (creation, update, delegation, blocking, and completion).

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add Task               | Create a task with title, description, quadrant, and optional delegation |
| Quadrant Assignment    | Tasks appear in one of 4 quadrants: Do, Schedule, Delegate, Delete       |
| Edit Task              | Modify task title, description, quadrant, delegation, etc.               |
| Move Between Quadrants | Drag & drop or reclassify tasks manually                                 |
| Complete Task          | Mark task as completed with timestamp                                    |
| Block Task             | Mark task as blocked with reason and timestamp                           |
| Unblock Task           | Resolve a blocker and record resolution timestamp                        |
| Delete Task            | Hard delete or soft-delete depending on quadrant                         |

## üì¶ Data Model (Used by Formula.SimpleRepo)

```csharp
public class EisenhowerTask : IAuditableEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public string Quadrant { get; set; } = "Do"; // Do, Schedule, Delegate, Delete
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
    public DateTime? CompletedAt { get; set; }
    public bool IsBlocked { get; set; }
    public string? BlockerReason { get; set; }
    public DateTime? BlockedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? UnblockedAt { get; set; }
    public string? DelegatedTo { get; set; }

## üß† Behavioral Rules

| Scenario                          | Behavior                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task marked ‚ÄúDone‚Äù                | `IsCompleted = true`, `CompletedAt = now()`              |
| Task flagged ‚ÄúBlocked‚Äù            | `IsBlocked = true`, `BlockerReason`, `BlockedAt = now()` |
| Task unblocked                    | `IsBlocked = false`, `UnblockedAt = now()`               |
| Task edited                       | `UpdatedAt = now()`                                      |
| Task deleted from ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù Q      | Task is fully removed from DB                            |
| Task deleted from other quadrants | Ask confirmation ‚Äî soft delete or move to ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù       |

---

## üß™ Validation Rules

* `Title` is required, 3‚Äì100 chars
* `Quadrant` must be one of `'Do'`, `'Schedule'`, `'Delegate'`, `'Delete'`
* If `IsBlocked = true`, `BlockerReason` is required
* If `IsCompleted = true`, set `CompletedAt` if null

---

## üîÑ Navigation & State

* Eisenhower Matrix is a standalone page (`/eisenhower`)
* State managed via `TaskService` (Scoped DI)
* UI binds to quadrant-specific `List<EisenhowerTask>` collections
* Service methods trigger DB sync via SimpleRepo

## üîó User Actions

| Action               | UI Element        | DB Update |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Create Task          | "Add Task" button | INSERT    |
| Move Quadrant        | Dropdown / drag   | UPDATE    |
| Edit Task            | Edit icon         | UPDATE    |
| Complete Task        | Checkmark / icon  | UPDATE    |
