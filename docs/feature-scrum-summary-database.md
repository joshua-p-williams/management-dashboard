## ‚öôÔ∏è Table Creation DDL

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ScrumNotes (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    EntryDate DATE NOT NULL,
    YesterdayNotes TEXT,
    TodayPlan TEXT,
    Blockers TEXT,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UpdatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## üîÅ Relationships

Currently, the `ScrumNotes` table is self-contained. In the future, it may reference:
- `Tasks` completed on a given day, for richer scrum summaries ([see Eisenhower Matrix Database](feature-eisenhower-matrix-database.md))
