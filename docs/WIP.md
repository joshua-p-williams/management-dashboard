Analyze the README.md and follow the links within it to the contents within the ./docs/ subfolder reading those markdown documents to get an understanding of the project that we are working on.  Then analalyze the solution itself to get an idea of what has already been built.  Then start looking at the ./docs/tasks.md as we will need to pick back up on the next unfinished tasks.  After you've done all this analysis report back to me if you agree we are in a state to continue.

Also familiarize yourself with the layout of the solution and it's various projects.

ManagementDashboard = MAUI Blazor Hybrid App
ManagementDashboard.Data = Data Access Layer holding all data models repositories and sql migrations
ManagementDashboard.Core = Where to store common business logic and services created in a testable way
ManagementDashboard.Tests = The unit testing project.

I want you to serve the role of a Software Engineer implementing various features for me.

TODO:
- [ ] Simplify Boolean Columns

---


# Simplify Boolean Columns

## Problem
- Some models and database tables use both a boolean column (e.g., `IsCompleted`) and a nullable timestamp (e.g., `CompletedAt`) to represent state.
- This is redundant: if `CompletedAt` is null, the item is not completed; if it has a value, it is completed. The same applies to other state booleans (e.g., `IsBlocked` vs. `BlockedAt`).
- We can simplify the schema and models by removing unnecessary boolean columns and using only the nullable timestamp fields.

## WIP Checklist
- [x] Identify all boolean/timestamp column pairs that can be reconciled (e.g., `IsCompleted`/`CompletedAt`, `IsBlocked`/`BlockedAt`)
- [x] Audit all models, migrations, and documentation for these columns
- [x] Update models to remove redundant boolean columns and use `[NotMapped]` for computed properties if needed
- [x] Update migrations to drop redundant columns
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the simplified schema
- [ ] Update repository and UI bindings as needed
- [ ] Test to ensure all logic and UI still work as expected

## Identified Columns for Reconciliation
- EisenhowerTask:
  - `IsCompleted` (can be replaced by `CompletedAt`)
  - `IsBlocked` (can be replaced by `BlockedAt`)
- (Continue audit for other models/tables...)

## Audit Results: Impacted Areas for Boolean Column Simplification

### 1. Data Models
- `EisenhowerTask` (ManagementDashboard.Data.Models.EisenhowerTask.cs):
  - Properties: `IsCompleted`, `IsBlocked` (now marked `[NotMapped]` and computed from `CompletedAt`/`BlockedAt`)
  - Interface: `IAuditableEntity` (updated: no boolean properties; only timestamps and blocker info)

### 2. Database Migrations
- `001_init.sql` (ManagementDashboard.Data.Migrations):
  - Columns: `IsCompleted`, `IsBlocked` (remove from schema, update migration logic)

### 3. Documentation
- `feature-eisenhower-matrix-database.md`, `feature-eisenhower-matrix.md`, `feature-scrum-summary.md`, and related docs:
  - Update schema tables, field descriptions, and logic to remove boolean columns and use only nullable timestamps.

### 4. Tests
- `EisenhowerTaskRepositoryTests.cs` (ManagementDashboard.Tests):
  - Test data and assertions reference `IsCompleted`, `IsBlocked`.
  - Update to use computed properties or timestamps.

### 5. UI Components & Bindings
- `TaskCard.razor`, `TaskEditor.razor`, `TaskAuditTrail.razor` (ManagementDashboard/Components):
  - Bindings and logic reference `IsCompleted`, `IsBlocked`.
  - Update to use computed properties or timestamps.
- `TaskEditor.razor.cs` (code-behind):
  - Logic for status, completion, and blocking uses booleans.

### 6. Services & Repositories
- Any service or repository logic that queries or sets `IsCompleted`/`IsBlocked`.
  - Update to use timestamps for state.

### 7. Queries & Filters
- Any LINQ or SQL queries filtering on `IsCompleted`/`IsBlocked`.
  - Update to use `CompletedAt IS NULL` or `BlockedAt IS NULL` as appropriate.

### Documentation Audit: Areas to Update for Boolean Column Simplification
- **feature-eisenhower-matrix-database.md**
  - Remove `IsCompleted` and `IsBlocked` columns from schema tables and DDL examples.
  - Update all references to these columns in field descriptions, queries, and sample SQL to use `CompletedAt`/`BlockedAt` null checks instead.
- **feature-eisenhower-matrix.md**
  - Update model code samples to remove boolean properties as mapped columns; show `[NotMapped]` computed properties if needed.
  - Update lifecycle and state logic to reference timestamps, not booleans.
  - Update all workflow and UI logic descriptions to use computed properties.
- **feature-scrum-summary.md**
  - Update any logic or query examples referencing `IsCompleted`/`IsBlocked` to use timestamp null checks.
- **database-definitions.md**
  - Update any schema diagrams, field lists, or explanations to remove boolean columns and clarify use of timestamps.
- **README.md**
  - If the feature or architecture summary mentions boolean columns for task state, update to clarify the use of nullable timestamps and computed properties.
- **architecture-definition.md**
  - Update any interface or model code samples to match the new approach (timestamps only, computed booleans as `[NotMapped]`).
- [ ] **Update all documentation above for consistency with the new model**

Add these documentation updates as a checklist item in the WIP to ensure all docs are revised for consistency with the new model.

### Formula.SimpleRepo Compatibility Notes
- Computed boolean properties (`IsCompleted`, `IsBlocked`) will be marked `[NotMapped]` and implemented as C# properties that check the corresponding timestamp fields (`CompletedAt`, `BlockedAt`).
- The POCO model will only map to actual database columns; computed properties are for business logic and UI only.
- Repository queries and constraints will use the timestamp fields for filtering (e.g., `CompletedAt IS NULL` for incomplete tasks).
- If querying by `IsCompleted`/`IsBlocked` is needed, add `[NotMapped]` properties to the constraints model and translate them to timestamp logic in custom constraints or repository logic.
- Documentation will clarify that these are computed properties, not database columns.
