## üìå Project Objectives

This platform is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Add new utilities over time without major refactor

## üß© Bootstrap 5 Maintenance & Upgrade Strategy

This project uses **Bootstrap 5 (currently v5.3.7)** for all UI styling, included as static assets for full offline support. To maintain and upgrade Bootstrap in a safe, predictable way:

1. **Location of Assets:**
   - CSS: `ManagementDashboard/wwwroot/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`
   - JS:  `ManagementDashboard/wwwroot/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js`

2. **Upgrade Process:**
   - Download the latest compiled Bootstrap assets from [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/).
   - Place the CSS and JS files in the `wwwroot/bootstrap/css/` and `wwwroot/bootstrap/js/` folders, respectively.
   - Test the app offline to confirm no regressions in layout or interactivity.
   - Review the [Bootstrap migration guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/migration/) for any breaking changes.
   - Update this README and any relevant documentation with the new version number and date.

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Never reference Bootstrap from a CDN or external source‚Äîalways use local files.
   - Keep custom CSS in separate files (e.g. `app.css`) to simplify Bootstrap upgrades.
   - After upgrading, check all major UI flows and run a full build/test cycle.

4. **Version Tracking:**
   - Document Bootstrap version and upgrade date in this section.
   - Example: `v5.3.7 added July 2025`
